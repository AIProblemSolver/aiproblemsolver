AI-Powered General Problem Solver

**Problems in reality** are the gaps between the current state and the desired state (goal). 
**Solving problems** means that (the problem solver) uses some tools, consumes some resources, and changes reality from its current state to the new state desired by stakeholders.

**Detailed Description:**

- A **problem** is the difference between the current state and the desired state (also called the goal). Solving problems means finding and implementing solutions to eliminate this difference.
- Goals are generated by stakeholders and are addressed by problem solvers. These two parties may be the same, or they may be different (in which case the stakeholders are the principals, and the problem solvers are their agents).
- Goals need to be translated into criteria to judge whether the solutions found are appropriate.

- When solving problems, the problem solver will follow a certain strategy to search for (or create) suitable solutions within the (infinite) solution space.
- This strategy may have established methods, or it may have no precedents to refer to.
- Solutions may have established templates, or they may have no precedents to refer to.

- During the problem-solving process, problem solvers will use tools and resources.
    - **Tools** refer to things that are reusable and helpful for solving problems.
        - Tools can include the narrow sense of visible tools, knowledge-level methods, or a combination of both.
        - Tools are usually not consumed and do not appear in the solution.
    - **Resources** refer to things that are consumed, scarce, and valuable during the problem-solving process.
        - Such as: time, energy, intelligence, money, power (privileges/ownership), credit (reputation/goodwill/interpersonal relationships), materials (raw materials), etc.
        - Resources may appear in the solution (e.g., raw materials).
- The use of these tools and resources is subject to constraints.

**Elements of Problem Solving:**

- Elements involved in the problem: Stakeholders/(problem solvers)/goals (expectations)/criteria/(constraints on tools and resources).
- Elements involved in the problem-solving process: (Problem) solving strategy.
- Elements involved in the problem-solving outcome: (Problem) solution.

**Decomposition in the Problem-Solving Process:**

- Solving real-world problems is usually divided into two stages: finding solutions (i.e., a series of implementable steps and methods that can achieve the goal) and implementing these solutions to change reality to the desired state.
- Real-world problems are usually complex and are often broken down into subproblems for resolution.
- The most common approach is to divide the problem into two subproblems based on the above two stages: the first problem focuses on finding solutions, and the second problem focuses on implementing solutions to change reality.
- These subproblems are further broken down into more subproblems. For example, finding solutions is often broken down into various subproblems related to understanding/analysis/attribution/answering/design/conception.
- Implementing solutions is usually divided into several implementation subproblems according to time stages and vertical field division of labor.

**Well-Defined and Ill-Defined Problems:**

- All problems can be divided into well-defined problems and ill-defined problems.
    - **Well-defined problems**: Goals and constraints are clear and specific, criteria have a single correct answer, problem-solving strategies have established routines, and problem solutions have established templates.
    - **Ill-defined problems**: Goals and constraints are vague, unknown, or conflicting, criteria have no single correct answer, solution strategies are unknown, and solutions have no established templates.

- Well-defined problems can be solved by following established strategies to find solutions with established templates.

- Ill-defined problems need to be first transformed into well-defined problems before they can be solved.
    - Clarify goals, constraints, and criteria.
        - Vague ones need to be clarified.
        - Unknown ones need to be explored and made known.
        - Conflicting ones need to be unified into a single standard.
    - Complex problems need to be decomposed first and then integrated.
    - Use creative thinking, adopt appropriate solution strategies, and construct innovative solutions.

**Based on the above understanding, we can develop an auxiliary tool to assist problem solvers in solving problems.**

**AI-Assisted Dynamic Problem Tree-Based Problem-Solving Tool:**

- **Problem Tree:**
    - Used to track information about subproblems at various levels decomposed during the problem-solving process, that is, the dependency relationships between them (including the root problem).
    - Includes:
        - Information about each problem: Number, description, stakeholders, goals, criteria, constraints and implicit assumptions, solutions (if any), and other relevant information.
        - Logical relationships between problems: Parent-child relationships, the decomposition logic from higher-level problems to lower-level problems.
- **Dynamic Problem Tree:**
    - The problem decomposition process is not a one-time, unchanging event, but is full of various iterations and repetitions.
    - For example:
        - As research progresses, the understanding of the problem becomes more in-depth and clear, necessitating revisions to the problem's relevant information.
        - As research progresses, the way problems are decomposed may also change, leading to changes in the original subproblem tree. When changes occur, existing research results need to be absorbed and reflected in the new relevant subproblems.
        - As research progresses and subproblems are gradually solved, we can gradually solve higher-level problems (solutions go from non-existent to existent, from vague to clear, from scattered to comprehensive, systematic, and complete).
- **AI-Assisted:**
    - The entire problem-solving process includes many steps that require intelligence, which can be completed by humans, AI, or humans with the help of AI.
    - This includes:
        - Processing and perfecting the information of the problem itself, decomposing the problem, solving subproblems that no longer need to be decomposed, and solving parent problems based on the solutions of subproblems.
